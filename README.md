# Whale-Off-the-Port-Folio-
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of pandas to cleanse data and analyse them to visualise the major key metrics of the portfolios. The results will then be used to for analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
